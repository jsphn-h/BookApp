# My Personal Project: BookList

## Description of BookList

What the application will do:
- It will enable the user to add books to several lists (e.g. books to read and book already read)
- The user can get a book recommendation from their To-Read list:
  1. by selecting a **genre**
  2. the system selects a **random** book
- The user can record the date when they finished reading a book

Who will use it?
- People who want to have a personal database which has records of books they read, books they want to read, and a system that can give recommendations from the books they want to read (instead of random books from the internet).

Why is this project of interest to me?
- The main reason is that I like reading.
- A couple of years ago I started having the habit of tracking books that I have read, and itâ€™s quite satisfying to see the number of books I have read over the years and how my tastes have changed or stayed the same. 
- However, I have two lists (books to read and books already read) and they're just word document lists with the titles (and date I finished reading).
- It would be really helpful if I was able to merge these two lists into one place (that isn't a super long list in a word document), and get a recommendation immediately instead of looking through the list then choosing.
